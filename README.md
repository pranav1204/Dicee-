One of the most important things is what I learned while making this app. See them below:

- Modularising code into separate classes.
- Dart classes and objects.
- Using class constructors.
- Extracting Widgets to refactor your code.
- private and public modifiers in Dart.
- How to use Dart lists.
- The difference between var, const and final.
- merge more than 2 images and adjustment of different widgets
- i also used flutter horizontal scroll view
- Used custom container
- link url and launch it in to app view and web view and connect default apps
